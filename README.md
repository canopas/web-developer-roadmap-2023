<h1 align="center">Web Developer Roadmap 2023</h1>

![web roadmap](https://github.com/canopas/web-developer-roadmap-2023/blob/main/images/title_image.png)

Web Developer Roadmap 2023 is a learning path to understand web development, including frontend, backend, and cloud(AWS).

## How to Learn Web Development?

Web development can be divided into four different parts,

1. Database
2. Backend
3. Frontend
4. Cloud(server)

## Guidelines

- Before starting any practical it's important to conduct research and learn the necessary concepts.

- As you progress through the practical exercises, make sure to apply the new knowledge you've gained in subsequent exercises.
- Follow the `best practices` and `coding standards` of particular languages for implementation.
